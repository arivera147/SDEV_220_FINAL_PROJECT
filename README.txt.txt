	The following program focuses on data structure and organization regarding the disease of Diabetes 
in 1000 patients. This data set was organized by Rashid Ahlam and taken from the website: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wj9rwkp9c2/1. The dataset displays data of confirmed diabetic, non-diabetic,
and predicted-diabetic case studies. The gender, age, and BMI were also recorded. Pertinent lab information such as
results of HgbA1c, Urea, Creatinine ratio, cholesterol, and lipid panel were also recorded. Note: Class within the dataset refers to whether the patient has diabetes, does not have diabetes, or is predicted to have diabetes.

	The program reads this information from a .csv file, and formats it into a data table for readability. 
The main purpose of this program was to visualize the dataset in a way where comparisons between different variables may be made and hypothesized. Was there any relativity between diabetic patients and their BMI? Were there noticeable differences in lab results between diabetic patient versus non-patients? Could we predict diabetes by only analyzing these lab results? The program opens with three options for the user to choose from: 1.) Display specific categories 2.) Create a graph from two chosen variables 3.) Display pre-programmed graphs that compare different lab results of patient classes. Exception handling exists to account for invalid or unavailable inputs from the user. 

	IMPORTANT TO RUN PROGRAM! Refer to requirements.txt file within the same directory before running. The following python libraries were installed for this project: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn. ADDITIONALLY: this program was created using Spyder (Python 3.12), which was launched through Anaconda. Spyder is a cross-platform IDE for scientific programming. This application makes it more accessible to view data visualization methods such as tables, charts, and graphs. I recommended launching and viewing this program through Spyder.
